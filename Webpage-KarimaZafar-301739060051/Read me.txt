In this webpage I used HTML and CSS, I inroduced myself a little, but I mainly focused on 
trying different styles, using images, buttons, menu, changing button highlights 
while hovering mouse pointer around it. Created different boxes, used different colors, 
added headers and footers, social media icons, copyrights, etc.
